Purpose		:   With PowerShell v3, not all help is included. Instead it needs to be downloaded from the internet.
                When no internet access is available (or desirable) and you want to save bandwidth you can create a local repository.

                This script creates the local PowerShell v3 Help Repository and creates a scheduledjob to update it daily.

Assumptions	:	
                

Known issues:	Created scheduled job is configured to run as the user that ran the script. Change manually if desired.

Limitations	:	

Notes   	:   -Based on the blog post : http://learn-powershell.net/2012/06/29/setting-up-a-windows-powershell-help-repository/
                
                -A file named "1. Update Command To Run on Systems to update PowerShell Help.ps1" is placed in the share as well that contains
                command you need to run on systems you want to update so you only have to browse to the share if you want to perform a manual update.

                -Consider deploying a GPO containing a scheduled task to update PowerShell v3 Help on a regular basis for all systems.

                This way you also don't have to wait for the updated PowerShell v3 Help fles to be downloaded when you need them.
